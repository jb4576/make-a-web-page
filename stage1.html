	<h1>HTML Key Concepts</h1>
	<h3>Lesson 1: Foundations of the Web and HTML</h3>
	<div class = "bodyNotes">
		<h3>How the Web Works</h3>
		<p>The web is a collection of computers, servers and devices that communicate using a variety of standards.  
		The most common standard for web pages is the the HTML <i>(Hypertext Markup Language)</i> standard with the latest common release being HTML5.
		These pages are commonly viewed on web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome.  Most web pages are delivered over TCP port 80 when performing an HTTP request.<br><br>
		A good resource for the basics on HTML can be found at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3schools.com</a>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class = "bodyNotes">
		<h3>Elements</h3>
		<p>HTML documents are made up of various HTML <i>elements</i> that have a start and an end tag with content in between.  The <i>elements</i> can work without an end tag but that <i>element</i> property will apply to all content after the start tag.
		An end tag is recommended regardless if it is required.<br><br>
		A good reference for elements can be found at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp">w3schools.com</a>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class = "bodyNotes">
		<h3>Attributes</h3>
		<p>HTML <i>attributes</i> provide additional details in reference to HTML elements.  These <i>attributes</i> can be an element value or provide additional information.<br><br>
		Additional information can be found at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp">w3schools.com</a>
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class = "bodyNotes">
		<h3>Block and Inline Elements</h3>
		<p>HTML elements are either <i>inline</i> or <i>block</i>. Block elements form an "invisible box" and divide the documents into sections.  Inline elements only occupy the space bounded by the tags of the inline element.
		</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Lesson 2: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</h3>
	<div class="bodyNotes">
		<h3>Google Chrome Developer Tools</h3>
		<p>The Google Chrome browser contains built in development tools that can be accessed through a menu or by entering in Ctrl+Shift+i.  The tools will help greatly with be able to understand how the browser is interpretting your code.  Additional details cane be found at the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools">Google Chrome DevTools Overview</a> page.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="bodyNotes">
		<h3>HTML Tree Structure</h3>
		<p/>The tree like structure comes from a tree / parent child relationship that creates a logical structure within documents.  The Document Object Model (DOM) is an API for markup documents that helps create the tree structure.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="bodyNotes">
		<h3>Webpage Layout Structure</h3>
		</p>Webpages when built using HTML contain box structures in order to create a design layout.  Many box structures can be used within one another in order to create as detailed of a layout as required.  These boxes are created within the tree strcture detailed previously.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="bodyNotes">
		<h3>Sublime and Code Editors</h3>
		<p>Programmers typically use special editors when writing code.  These editors assist by color coding different tags and auto completing a closed tag when an opening tag is generated.  Sublime is the most popular code editor but many other options exists as well such as Notepad++.  Progamming without an editor is possible but not recommended.</p>
	</div>
<div class="pageWrap">
	<h3>Leason 3: Adding CSS Style to HTML Structure</h3>
	<div class="bodyNotes">
		<h3>CSS</h3>
		<p>CSS stands for <i>Cascading Style Sheets</i> and it defines how HTML elements are to be displayed.  A style sheet is added by inserting the line <code>&ltlink rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="nameofstylesheet.css"&gt</code> at the top of your HTML document.  Style can be inherited through the parent tree structure, so the page design needs to take that into account.  Style should not be set in the HTML document but rather in the CSS file.</p>
	</div>

	<div class = "bodyNotes">
		<h3>Avoiding Repetition</h3>
		<p>CSS greatly reduces the amount of repititive code in a document by allowing style elements to be grouped and reused throughout the document.  With common pieces of code being used for style throughout a document, it allows a great amount of flexibility where the overall site design can be changed rapidly without having to modify individual elements in HTML.</p>
